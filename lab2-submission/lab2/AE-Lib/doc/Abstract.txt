The AE-Lib has the following source Groups:

AE:     
    It contains auto-tester general purpose routines. 
    You may change the implementation as long as you keep the interface of functions unchanged. 
    The files are:    
    - ae.c: the auto-tester initialization routines
    - ae_util.c: the auto-tester utility functions
    - ae_tasks_util.c: the auto-tester task tests related utility function
    - main.c the main.c used by the auto-tester. One should exclude main from rtx-app project when using AE-Lib
    
AE-public: 
    It contains public testing suites released by lab staff. By default, this source group is included from the build.
    The public testing cases takes the Group ID number of 99 in the file name. 
    The naming convention of the public testing stuie is ae_tasks<suite ID>_Group99.c or ae_tasks[suite_ID].c
    For example:
    ae_tasks200_G99.c is Test Suite 200 by Group 99, which is the lab teaching team.
    ae_tasks.c is the initial dummy test suite written by lab teaching team to get starter code working
    
    Only one of the .c file in this source group is included in the build. 

AE-stu:
    It contains students' testing suites. Each testing suit is in a separate .c file. 
    The naming convention is ae_tasks<suite ID>_G<group id>.c.  For example
    ae_tasks1_Gxx.c is the Test Suite 1 from Group xx, where xx is the group ID number.
    By default, this source group is excluded from the build.
    
AE-active:
    It contains the active testing suite that you want to use.
    By default it is empty.
    To use a student's test suite .c file, 
    - Activate the Project ae-lib in the workspace 
    - Exclude the AE-public folder from the build.
    - Drag the corresponding student's testing suite file to the AE-active folder.
IMPORTANT    
    When submit, you should 
    - leave the AE-active folder empty and 
    - include the following groups in the build
        * AE
        * AE-public
        * AE-active
    - exclude the following troup in the build
        * AE-stu
